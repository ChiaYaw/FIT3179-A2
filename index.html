    <h1>Victimisation in Australia from 2008 to 2022</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center">
      Victimisation refers to the process of being made a victim <br />
      of a crime or unfair treatment. It involves individuals experiencing
      <br />
      harm, suffering, or loss due to the actions of others. <br />
      Victimisation can occur in various forms, such as <br />
      physical assault, theft, or emotional abuse.

            Victimisation rate refers to the percentage of individuals who
            have<br />
            experienced a particular crime within a specified period. This
            map<br />
            provides a visual representation of the victimisation rates across
            different <br />
            states and territories in Australia for the year 2022. A<br />
            victimisation rate of 1.3% means that 1.3 out of every<br />
            100 individuals have experienced a particular crime, such as
            physical<br />

            assault, within the specified period. To put this into
            perspective,<br />
            countries with lower victimisation rates, such as Japan, often
            report<br />
            rates below 1%, indicating a relatively safer environment. On the
            <br />
            other hand, some countries with higher crime rates may report<br />
            timisation rates above 5%, highlighting more significant safety.
            This comparison<br />
            helps us understand the relative safety of different regions within
            Australia.
